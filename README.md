# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The analysis is performed on a dataset containing customer information from a mall, including demographics, spending habits, and campaign responses.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, removing outliers, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for clustering.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most important features.
3. **Clustering**: Implementing the K-Means algorithm to group customers into distinct segments based on their similarities.
4. **Cluster Analysis**: Analyzing and profiling the identified customer segments to derive actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Prerequisites

The following libraries are required to run this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- yellowbrick (for visualizing the Elbow method)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in your preferred environment.
4. Run the cells sequentially to follow the analysis process.

## Results

The analysis identifies distinct customer segments based on features like income, age, family structure, spending habits, and campaign response rates. These segments can be used to develop targeted marketing campaigns tailored to each customer group's preferences and behaviors.
